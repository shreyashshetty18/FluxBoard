# Productivity Dashboard ✅

A small, polished personal dashboard built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to help you stay productive.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ To-Do List (persisted in `localStorage`)
- 🗓️ Daily Planner (hourly notes, saved in `localStorage`)
- 💬 Motivational Quote (fetched from the Quotable API)
- ⏱️ Pomodoro Timer (work/break sessions)
- ☁️ Weather summary (uses WeatherAPI — API key is removed for security)
- 🎨 Theme switcher (cycle through predefined color themes)

## ▶️ How to run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser. (Or run a simple server during development):
   - `python -m http.server 8000`
2. Interact with the dashboard features directly in the UI.

> Note: To enable live weather data, add your WeatherAPI key to `script.js` (the `apiKey` variable).
